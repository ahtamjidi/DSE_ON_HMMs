This package contains LaTeX-CAD, a drawing program running
under Windows which produces drawing commands for LaTeX. 
The resulting drawings may be incorporated into a .tex 
source file, edited, and viewed using a DVI viewer such 
as DVIWIN, or alternatively converted to PostScript using dvips.
Please generate and print the file latexcad.ps (preferred)
or latexcad.dvi for more extensive documentation, and a 
list of changes since previous versions. The documentation file 
latexcad.tex assumes A4 size paper - if using Letter paper, just 
remove the  `a4paper' from the preamble. To typeset properly, the
`lgrind' package for source code formatting is required. It's 
available on CTAN. if you don't have it present, one example 
(graph plotting) will be omitted, but the rest will compile 
satisfactorily.
If all this is too hard, just use the PostScript documentation!

LaTeX-CAD contains some 2e-specific macros. However, it is not 
yet fully 2e-compliant (one day.....)

The distribution file is named latexcad__.zip, where `__' is
the version number without the decimal point. When loading onto 
a DOS system, this should be truncated to latexcad.zip to fit 
within the normal 8+3 filename sizes.

The package contains the following:
latexcad.txt    - this file
latexcad.exe    - executable file 
latexcad.ps     - documentation in PostScript form
vbrun300.dll    - dynamic link library
cmdialog.vbx    - common dialog control
commdlg.dll     - Windows common dialog
latexcad.sty    - macro file
latexcad.tex    - documentation file
latexcad.hlp    - Windows help file
lcadeg.lp       -   "      "
gnuplot.lp      -   "      "
linethic.lp     -   "      "
ploteg.lg       -   "      "
lgrind.sty      -   "      "
fancybox.*      - box drawing macro package
epic.*          - picture macro package
eepic.*         - extended picture macro package
epsf.*          - PostScript macro package
rotate.*        - PostScript rotation package
macros.tex      - Example usage 
test.*          - support for above
ploteg.bas      - example for data file plotting

The documentation contains instructions on setting up the package
and its operation. It requires LaTeX to compile and a dvi driver to
print/preview. It is recommended to use a PostScript output device
so as to be able to view the PostScript objects in the documentation.
(Note, however, LaTeX-CAD will work without a PostScript output device,
although shaded objects and rotated text may not be available).
