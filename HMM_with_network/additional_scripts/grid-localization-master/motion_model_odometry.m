%MOTION_MODEL Motion Model using Odometry for p(xt | ut, xt_d1)
%   Probabilistic Robotics, Thrun et al., p 134
%   inputs:
%       xt = (x_prime y_prime theta_prime): hypothesized successor pose
%       ut = (xbart_d1 xbart): motion information based on odometry
%       xt_d1 = (x y theta): initial robot pose
%       params = (a1 a2 a3 a4): noise parameters
%   output:
%       p: the probability of being at the hypothesized pose xt
%
%   Information about ut = (xbart_d1 xbart):
%       this is a relative advance from xbart_d1 to xbart. Basically a
%       difference. (p. 133)
%       xbart_d1 = (xbar ybar thetabar)
%       xbart = (xbar_prime ybar_prime thetabar_prime)
%
%   Information about params = (a1 a2 a3 a4):
%       "robot-specific paramerters that specify the noise in robot motion"
%       (p. 135 or p. 139). See Figure 5.8 in book for visualization of
%       different params.

%   Code taken from: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2323034/2392520
%   Note that MATLAB's (and Python's) mod() function automatically makes
%   the angle positive, therefore, we comment this line out here.

%   `angle` is expected in radians

    % reduce the angle
    angle = mod(angle, 2*pi);
    
    % force it to be the positive remainder, so that 0 <= angle < 360
